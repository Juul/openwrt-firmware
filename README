This is a fork of sudomesh firmware. 

The goal is to create a firmware for mapping wifi channel usage and general speectrum usage.

Features of this firmware:

* Serial console output is disabled as much as possible
** To allow direct hookup of GPS receiver via serial.
* Only configured for ar71xx and atheros chips.
* Spectral analysis is only available on ar71xx (hardware limitation)

sudo mesh is working on both a bike and car mountable rig for spectrum analysis:

*1x Ubiquiti Bullet 2 HP (for 2.4 ghz wifi channel scan)
*1x Ubiquiti Bullet 5 HP (for 5 ghz wifi channel scan)
*1x Ubiquiti Bullet M2 (for 2.4 ghz spectrum analysis)
*1x Ubiquiti Bullet M5 (for 5 ghz spectrum analysis)
*All bullets with high-gain omni antennas attached
*Passive five-port ethernet hub with PoE injection

*Lithium-ion 12 volt battery pack.
*One 3.3 volt GPS module with serial interface (e.g. Ublox Neo 6m)
**http://dx.com/p/gy-neo6mv2-flight-controller-gps-module-blue-232595

The GPS module can be connected to any one of the bullets via serial.
It provides position and timestamp data.
All nodes broadcast wifi/spectrum/gps/time information.
All nodes log their own and all received info to a temporary file (in ram).

Before battery runs out, some computer is plugged into the fifth ethernet port on the passive hub and uses scp to copy the temporary file into permanent storage.
